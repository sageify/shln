## Minimal Error Checking

Error checking is at a minmum and the underlying commands are allowed to fail and emit messages.


## Domain and Context Names

Environment variable names used by the utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1-2017 consist solely of uppercase letters, digits, and the <underscore> ( '_' ) from the characters defined in Portable Character Set and do not begin with a digit.

However, names are allowed to begin with a digit as they will not be stored directly in an environment variable and a prefixed.
